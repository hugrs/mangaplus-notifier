# mangaplus-notifier
A Python script that notifies you when a new chapter releases on Mangaplus (https://mangaplus.shueisha.co.jp)

I was tired of missing chapters of Spy x Family so I wrote this script to get a desktop notification whenever a new chapter is released.

Works on Linux with a GNOME-based desktop
